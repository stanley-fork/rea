# MCP runtime contracts

## Generated catalog

Run `npm run docs:generate` in a source checkout to generate the machine-readable
catalog at `docs/public/product-catalog.json`. Documentation deployments serve
the same file at [/rea/product-catalog.json](/rea/product-catalog.json). PR CI retains it with the packaged
skill and portable conformance projections in the `generated-docs` artifact.
These outputs describe the exact source revision being built; they are not
checked-in snapshots. For a running server, `binary_session` remains the
authoritative source of catalog identity and tool availability.

## Identity and discovery

`binary_session` reports the active package, server, SDK, and negotiated
protocol details. `rea doctor` separately inspects supported JSON/TOML client
registrations, reports their command vectors as aligned, stale, missing, or
invalid, and keeps live-server state `unknown` unless the active connection
supplies identity.

`tools/list` returns the complete canonical tool inventory, including tools that
are currently unavailable. Opening or closing a target or observing a provider
health transition leaves that catalog unchanged and does not emit
`notifications/tools/list_changed`.

Advertised input and output schemas contain no reachable recursive references.
Schemas share repeated definitions through schema-local references while
preserving complete nested fields and validation rules. Input properties retain
their descriptions and literal examples.

Hosts forward input schemas to the model with every request, so advertised
examples never copy complete producer Evidence. An embedded Evidence record is
shown as its exact `{"kind":"retained-evidence","evidence_id":"ev_..."}`
reference where the tool accepts one. An example that can only carry inline
Evidence stays in the canonical contract and its executable tests, but is not
advertised. Every advertised example is a distinct valid canonical input.

Root object unions are presented as
one object without root `anyOf`, `oneOf`, or `allOf` for model API compatibility.
The projection merges properties, retains shared required fields and
group-specific field dependencies, and describes the accepted input groups.
Canonical runtime validation enforces the exact union, including exclusions
that the advertised projection does not express. Tests validate the schemas
after SDK conversion and check advertised validation and actual calls.
Individual model APIs can impose additional nesting limits; complete producer
captures can exceed ten structural levels.

### Compact input schema profile

Some function-calling providers reject a request while any single tool's
`parameters` schema exceeds a literal serialized size cap; Moonshot clients
such as kimi-cli fail every request while the default catalog is attached
([#1484](https://github.com/morluto/rea/issues/1484)). Setting the server's
`REA_MCP_INPUT_SCHEMA_PROFILE` environment variable to `compact` renders every
advertised input schema within a 13,312-byte budget, measured to sit below
Moonshot's observed cap (community measurements: a 13.7 KB schema is accepted
while a ~15 KB one is rejected). The setting is read at startup; restart the
server to apply changes, as with `REA_MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`. The default
value `full` keeps the complete advertisement unchanged.

The compact profile renders the same tool set, output schemas, annotations,
and canonical server-side validation. It changes only the advertised input
JSON Schema:

- Annotation prose leaves the advertised form: nested property descriptions,
  literal examples, defaults, and titles are dropped. The root keeps its
  description because it states the accepted input groups.
- Schema-local references are inlined within the budget. Kimi Code expands
  references before sending provider requests, so sharing definitions cannot
  establish the provider-facing size. Expansion stops at the budget before
  allocating an oversized presentation. Unconstrained JSON fields advertise
  all JSON value types explicitly so Kimi cannot infer string for Evidence
  objects or arrays.
- The few schemas whose validation structure alone exceeds the budget
  (`compare_web_captures`, `build_reconstruction_obligation_ledger`,
  `evaluate_reconstruction_coverage`, `project_managed_application_graph`,
  `compare_application_versions`, `capture_browser_scenario`) are advertised
  in a reduced form: property names, reference-resolved types (including union
  alternatives), first-level guidance, and the root's required-field constraints,
  with nested validation detail elided. The
  canonical schema still rejects malformed calls server-side, so callers
  following the reduced advertisement receive the canonical typed error
  instead of silent acceptance.

Boundary tests pin every advertised compact schema to the budget, keep them
valid JSON Schema that still accepts every canonical example, and hold the
set of six reduced presentations as contracts evolve. Client verification
also checks provider-facing sizes and canonical examples after conversion by
the actual Kimi Code CLI; local captures do not establish Moonshot acceptance.

Self-contained output schemas advertise a content-bound `$id`, including their
declared dialect. SDK validators can reuse compiled schemas across complete
catalog refreshes and equivalent tool outputs; changing the schema changes its
identity. Explicit schema IDs and relative external reference bases are
preserved. This keeps every tool and validation rule in discovery and does not
change the SDK's catalog invalidation or availability checks.

`compare_web_captures` accepts exactly one of two input shapes:

- Passive: `before` and `after` each contain `inspection`, the complete
  `normalized_result` from `inspect_web_page`. Each may also contain `webmcp`,
  the complete `normalized_result` from `discover_webmcp_tools`, or null.
- Scenario: `before_scenario` and `after_scenario` contain complete
  `normalized_result` objects from `capture_browser_scenario`. Optional
  `normalization` defaults to `{ "rules": [] }`.

The advertised schema includes complete nested capture fields and rejects
incomplete pairs and structurally malformed captures. Mixed comparison families
can pass advertised validation; the SDK rejects them against the canonical
input schema before invoking the handler. Domain validation additionally checks
relationships such as event sequence references and retained counts; JSON
Schema does not express those cross-field invariants.

Call `binary_session` with `{}` and read `result.tool_availability` to choose a
callable operation for the current target, provider, host, and negotiated client
capabilities. The default result includes the complete inventory with each
tool's availability, reason, and remediation. Each entry also reports required
and optional negotiated client features plus the currently missing features.
The optional inputs `expected_package_version`, `expected_catalog_digest`, and
`expected_server_path` compare the live session with the caller's expectations.

`binary_session.analysis_provider_candidates` is authoritative for deep-engine
discovery. Target-free discovery is sorted by provider ID, reports host
availability and `unknown` target support, and does not create an analysis
client. `open_binary.provider_id` accepts a concrete provider ID or `auto`; it
uses the same parser and selection policy as CLI `--provider` and
`REA_ANALYSIS_PROVIDER`. A successful deep open exposes one immutable provider,
concrete version, selection source, and complete analysis profile through
`analysis_provider_binding`. Ambiguity and unknown, unavailable, or unsupported
choices return typed selection details. A selected provider is never replaced
automatically after a runtime failure.

Every successful target transition allocates `binary_session.analysis_run.run_id`
before any provider startup. `process_lineage` is `not_observed` until a dynamic
provider starts, then becomes `snapshots` with every started provider's identity
and retained ownership observation. Each observation records `observed_at` and
is `unavailable` with a reason when ownership could not be revalidated, or
`verified` with launcher PID, parent PID, process group, and descendants observed
at that bounded check. These are historical snapshots, not live process
inventories, and do not claim that no short-lived descendant existed.

## Progress and cancellation

Tool execution failures return `isError: true` and the complete canonical
`{ "error": ... }` diagnostic as JSON in text `content`. Read that diagnostic
for the error code, target details, partial observations, and remediation.
Failures omit `structuredContent`, since each advertised `outputSchema`
describes successful results. Successful replies retain their schema-validated
structured data and matching text projection. Oversized errors are retained
as Evidence before delivery of a bounded diagnostic with an export reference;
if retention is unavailable or fails, the diagnostic reports that reason.

REA accepts ordinary `tools/call` progress tokens. Updates are monotonic,
rate-bounded to at most one intermediate update per 100 ms, and always allow a
terminal update. Unknown totals are omitted; REA does not fabricate percentages.
`capture_process_scenario` uses that boundary only when the client supplies a
progress token. Notifications set `progress` to the count of collected terminal
frames, process samples, and interaction events, omit `total`, and put the
lifecycle phase, elapsed time, and final cleanup status in `message`. A client
that does not send a progress token receives no progress notifications. The
tool result is unchanged either way.
Provider calls receive the request cancellation signal. Artifact traversal,
hashing, version comparisons, Hopper requests, and process capture
check the same signal. Cancellation is distinct from timeout. A cleanup failure
uses `cleanup_incomplete` and lists only the owned resource kinds that remain.
Native call tracing and process capture retain available observations in
`details.partial_observation` on failure, including when cleanup succeeds.
The observation reports its partial coverage; cleanup details describe host
state separately from the execution failure.
A process capture that fails during a finalization interval keeps every signal
attempt and its delivery result in `details.partial_observation`, with
`elapsed_ms` and `exit_code` null when no exit was observed.
Derived comparisons and reconstruction verification yield before computation
and before publication, so cancellation cannot race with successful Evidence.

`analyze_javascript_application` also yields between reconstruction phases and
during graph/result sealing, cross-graph binding checks, Evidence JSON validation,
and canonical hashing. Its final result validation reuses exact graphs whose
owned constructors validated and completely sealed them; imported graphs still
receive full schema and commitment checks.
Cancellation observed before completion returns `cancelled` and prevents the
provisional result from entering the session ledger; prior Evidence stays usable.
Single-file parsing, graph construction, and validation of imported graphs
still run synchronously, so control messages can wait for those
phases to release the event loop. A rejected client promise alone does not
establish that the server has stopped its work.

Direct CLI analysis calls work without a progress token and translate SIGINT or
SIGTERM into the same AbortSignal used by providers. Signal guards remain active
through provider cleanup, including repeated delivery by package runners.
Existing controlled-process cleanup and provider shutdown rules still apply;
REA never kills a process it cannot prove it owns.

## Ghidra first-query deadlines and recovery

A successful MCP initialize handshake establishes the REA connection.
`open_binary` then selects a target and provider binding; it does not establish
that Ghidra has finished importing the target. The first Ghidra-backed query,
such as `binary_overview`, starts the engine and waits for import, default
auto-analysis, bridge connection, and health readiness before returning analysis.

These deadlines have different owners:

| Deadline             | Owner and effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MCP initialize       | The client bounds transport/REA connection startup, before any target query.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Ghidra startup       | REA allows 330,000 ms by default; `REA_GHIDRA_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` accepts decimal integers from 1–2,147,483,647 ms. Invalid supplied values fail configuration validation. Startup failure is reported by the first provider query. |
| Individual tool call | The client bounds its wait, including cold engine startup. The pinned client SDK 2.3.1 defaults to 60,000 ms and can cancel earlier than REA's startup deadline.                                                                    |

For an already connected client using the pinned SDK, request options are the
**second** argument of `callTool`:

```js
const overview = await client.callTool(
  { name: "binary_overview", arguments: {} },
  {
    timeout: 240000,
    onprogress: ({ progress, total, message }) => {
      console.error({ progress, total, message });
    },
  },
);
```

The SDK's `onprogress` option supplies a progress token and handles matching
notifications. A raw MCP client can instead send `_meta.progressToken` in the
request and handle `notifications/progress`. Progress reports do not establish
engine readiness or a percentage of Ghidra auto-analysis. A longer server
startup allowance does not extend the client's deadline; progress also does not
extend it unless the client explicitly implements that policy.

The 240-second setting is a measured example, not a universal timeout: a
controlled Linux x64/WSL2 fixture took about 64 seconds for its first overview
with Ghidra 12.1.4 on a mounted NTFS installation, native JDK 21, two CPUs, and a
512 MiB Java heap. Target size, storage, and analysis work can change that time.
Configure the deadline in the caller's existing request settings; it is not a
tool argument, setup grant, or server-side automatic extension. CLI analysis has
no MCP client request deadline, but keeps the provider startup deadline and
SIGINT cancellation.

If the client timed out or cancelled during startup, the pending query may have
been interrupted. Reissuing `open_binary` for the same active target can reuse
the current client, so it is not a fresh-start recovery. On the same connection:

1. Keep any useful inline Evidence, or export a bundle before closing if retained
   records are needed. `binary_session` can show the selected binding and its
   recorded state; target selection alone does not prove engine readiness.
2. Call `close_binary` and check its result. It drains owned work, closes the
   provider, and clears retained session records. A `cleanup_incomplete` result
   must be addressed according to its reported owned resources before retrying.
3. Call `open_binary` with the same caller-selected path and
   `provider_id: "ghidra"`, then retry the first query with an appropriate client
   deadline. The connection and selected provider do not need to change.

This close/reopen flow was exercised on one real Linux stdio connection after a
controlled startup timeout, followed by a successful overview and function
analysis. A separate Windows x64 stdio run with Ghidra 12.1.4, JDK 21 and Node
22.19.0 exercised the same connection and caller-selected native PE: the default
60-second client request timed out, close succeeded, and reopening before a
240-second request completed the cold overview in about 163 seconds. The next
overview took about 19 ms. The cold and warm overviews reported two procedures
and two segments; the input digest was unchanged and no owned runtime root or
observed process-family member remained after final close. This was a small
1,024-byte fixture, so the longer request setting remains an example, not a
guarantee for larger targets. No macOS cold-start recovery was exercised.

With a supplied progress token, the Windows run received an operation-start
notification before timeout and start/completion notifications for the
successful retry. It received no intermediate import or auto-analysis progress.
These operation markers do not measure analysis work completed or extend the
client's deadline. Each new provider session still imports the target into a
fresh temporary project.

REA cleans only resources it owns and never switches to another provider
automatically. A provider timeout, installation failure, or host permission
denial needs its own reported recovery; increasing a client deadline alone does
not fix those failures.

## Tool results

Custom clients upgrading from 6.1 should follow the
[6.2 migration guide](migration-6.2.md#mcp-results-and-evidence).

Evidence-producing tools return the complete canonical Evidence record in both
text and structured content. Read `structuredContent.normalized_result` for the
operation result and `structuredContent.evidence_id` for its identity.
`raw_result` holds a provider representation distinct from that result, such
as an upstream tool's original report, and is `null` when there is none. The same
record is retained in the session bundle. `analysis_profile` is always present:
a concrete profile object or `null`; either value participates in semantic
identity. Records omitting this field are rejected. Pass the returned Evidence
directly to a compatible comparison tool: `analyze_function` Evidence can be passed
directly to `compare_functions`, and `inspect_artifact` Evidence to
`compare_artifacts`. Use `get_evidence_bundle` when the task needs broader
retained session history or an explicit bundle for transfer.

REA prepares complete MCP results within the pinned stdio client's 10 MiB
receive-buffer budget, including both text and structured representations and
room for the JSON-RPC envelope. Tool errors carry only their text
representation, so only that text counts against the budget. Response budget settings are captured at startup;
restart or recreate the server to apply changes. If a result cannot fit, REA returns
`resource_constraint` with `details.resource: "transport"` before constructing
a document-sized string. Analysis Evidence remains complete in the current
session. Its exact reference is reported in
`details.reported_limits.evidence_reference`; call `inspect_analysis_view` with
that reference for a summary, one section/module, or a stable page, or call
`export_evidence_bundle` with a destination path. Complete
bundle exports stream canonical JSON into an atomically published file. A broad
follow-up or `get_evidence_bundle` can also exceed the response budget; exporting
preserves the complete session without sending it through a single MCP frame.
To discover existing records without their large payloads, call
`get_evidence_bundle` with `detail: "summary"`. Its `result.records` contain
Evidence IDs, artifact/provider identities, analysis-profile digests and native
procedure metadata. Optional `filters` match exact `evidence_id`, `operation`,
`target_sha256`, `analysis_profile_digest` or `procedure_address`. Use a discovered
ID with `inspect_analysis_view`; neither discovery nor retained selection starts
a provider. `retention: "complete-record"` describes stored Evidence, while
`native_dossier.value_flow` independently reports truncation, unavailable or
unknown metadata. Missing omission counts remain null. Summary output carries
every matching record; actual transport admission still applies. Omitted
`detail` preserves complete canonical bundle delivery; filters require summary.

For a portable exported bundle, the CLI shares this projection:
`rea inspect-evidence-bundle '{"path":"/tmp/evidence.json","detail":"summary","filters":{"operation":"analyze_function"}}' --format json`.
The CLI validates and materializes that local bundle under its existing memory
budget; summary delivery does not make arbitrary large files cheap to import.

Cancelling an export stops further serialization and removes its staging file.
The destination changes only when a complete export is atomically published.

Clients that explicitly configure a larger receive buffer can set the REA
server's `REA_MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` environment variable to the same byte
count. This setting must be a safe decimal integer at least 10485760; REA
reserves 1024 bytes for the envelope. Raising it restores complete inline
delivery for responses that fit that buffer and Node's single-string limit.
It does not change the client's buffer, analysis coverage, or retained content.
Ordinary responses keep their existing complete result contract.

## Retained application Evidence inputs

`analyze_javascript_application` and `inspect_binary_layout` accept `detail`:
`complete` (default) returns the complete analysis Evidence; `summary` records
that complete Evidence in the session and returns the derived
`inspect_analysis_view` summary Evidence instead. Its
`normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` and `evidence_links` name the retained
analysis, so later views and application workflows read it without repeating
analysis or moving the complete record through the response. A server without
session retention refuses summary detail with `capability_unavailable`.

`inspect_analysis_view` projects a caller-selected view of already completed
`inspect_binary_layout`, `analyze_javascript_application`, or `analyze_function`
Evidence. Native views select procedure, pseudocode, assembly, basic blocks,
comments, callers/callees, references, unresolved calls, referenced strings and
names, the native API record, and high-pcode facets without starting a provider. Native offset
and limit default to 0 and 64; pseudocode uses UTF-16 code units and never
splits surrogate pairs, while other pages count rows. Unavailable facts and
provider limitations remain explicit. Source is
an exact same-session retained reference or portable inline Evidence. Views are
a summary, a layout mitigations or linkage facet, one section/symbol/module, or
a stable page with a caller-selected positive `limit`. Module pages include
JavaScript assets, bundled modules, and source modules. Select an exact
`node_id` when a path is ambiguous or unavailable. Module items retain their
recorded property values and source locations; summaries include parent
application and semantic coverage. The result carries a digest of the selected
facts. Actual serialized size determines MCP transport admission: reduce the
page size or export retained Evidence if the view is too large.

`trace_application_feature`, `trace_javascript_semantics`,
`compare_application_versions`, `compare_source_to_bundle`, and
`compare_javascript_export_shapes` accept complete inline application Evidence
or an exact reference to a record already retained by the current connection:

```json
{
  "name": "trace_application_feature",
  "arguments": {
    "application": {
      "kind": "retained-evidence",
      "evidence_id": "ev_<64 lowercase hex characters>"
    },
    "seed": { "kind": "module", "value": "search.js", "match": "exact" }
  }
}
```

Use the `evidence_id` returned by `analyze_javascript_application` (or another
compatible application-graph producer). Comparisons accept this form in `left`
and `right`; each side can independently be inline or retained. Native
observation arrays continue to take complete inline Evidence. Results and their
Evidence remain complete inline, and both input forms pass the same semantic,
identity, authority, and provenance checks without running the producer again.

References belong to the current connection's Evidence ledger. Opening another
target preserves retained records; `close_binary` clears them, even when no
binary is active. A fresh connection has its own ledger. A missing reference
reports its exact ID and `details.reason: "missing"`; the server cannot infer
whether it was never recorded, cleared, or retained by another connection.
Supply complete inline Evidence, repeat its producer, or import an exported
Evidence bundle before referencing that imported record. Export a bundle before
closing if the investigation needs it later.

CLI application workflows continue to read portable inline Evidence from files
and run the same analysis workflows; a standalone CLI invocation cannot resolve
another MCP connection's retained records. No additional lookup call, provider
selection, or approval step is required for a same-session follow-up.

## Aggregate native context

`get_navigation_context` composes the selected document, current address, and
current/containing procedure. Its capability inventory exposes a
`current_selection` mode and an `explicit_document` mode; the latter works when
the caller supplies `document` and the provider lacks `current_document`. A
cursor outside a procedure is represented as
`procedure: null`. `inspect_address_context` requires an explicit address and
returns name, procedure, comment, inline-comment, and bookmark facets;
unsupported facets are local `unavailable` outcomes. Use `current_document`,
`current_address`, and `current_procedure` for direct single-field lookups; use
the aggregate tools when you need related context together.

## Request scope and local effects

Each tool request names the target and lifecycle it will use. Browser calls
carry a loopback CDP endpoint and target ID, with optional origin filters;
process and Electron scenarios carry the executable, arguments, actions, and
cleanup behavior; artifact tools carry the input path and requested operation.
REA runs the declared request directly and does not infer a broader target or
action from it.

REA does not require permission grants or per-call approval flags. Setup still
prints its plan and requires confirmation before changing configuration or
installing Hopper. MCP clients control their own confirmation UI.

Tool annotations describe effects and are hints, not authorization controls
([MCP ToolAnnotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/schema#toolannotations)).
`readOnlyHint` includes session state: an analysis call that records additive
Evidence is marked non-read-only even when it leaves the target unchanged.
`destructiveHint` describes possible data loss, not ordinary Evidence recording.
Effect metadata covers possible behavior across supported inputs: DMG inventory
can launch `hdiutil` and create an owned temporary mount directory; extraction
creates a fresh output directory on every call. Comparing supplied web captures
or PNG artifacts uses local data without contacting the browser.

Host requirements remain in force. macOS may deny Accessibility,
Screen Recording, or native mounting; provider tools require their selected
analysis runtime. These failures are reported at the operation that needs
them. A configured provider or an endpoint alone does not establish that a
target is supported.

Evidence bundles, snapshots, and extraction use the paths and output behavior
declared by their tools. Artifact extraction materializes the selected regular
files into a fresh REA-chosen temporary directory and reports its path.

`analyze_javascript_application` reads the supplied local directory or ASAR path
and returns its result and Evidence inline.

## Integrity record-and-continue

Artifact integrity fails closed by default. A request can explicitly select
`integrity_policy=record-and-continue` when the investigation needs verified
siblings to continue after a mismatch.

Contradictory bytes are quarantined from nested expansion and recorded with
declared and observed hashes, trust, provenance, path, and unpacked state.
Verified siblings continue. Comparisons classify the result as a contradiction
and reconstruction cannot treat it as unchanged.

`analyze_javascript_application` accepts the same policy in MCP and as
`--integrity-policy` on both JavaScript CLI routes. Its result returns the
canonical `integrity_contradictions` records and marks application graph
coverage partial when any mismatch is continued. Contradicted nested ASARs
remain opaque.

`extract_artifact` accepts the same policy in MCP and as `--integrity-policy`
on `rea extract-artifact`. With `record-and-continue` it writes the observed
bytes and returns the `integrity_contradictions` records for the extracted
files. An active ASAR unpacked entry whose companion file is absent cannot be
materialized; extraction fails as `unavailable` with that logical path.

Packaging tools commonly sign or strip `.asar.unpacked` native binaries after
writing the archive header, so their declared hashes no longer match. Electron
does not check unpacked companions against those hashes at runtime. Integrity
failures for such entries name this cause and the operation to rerun with
`record-and-continue`; REA does not exempt unpacked entries silently.
